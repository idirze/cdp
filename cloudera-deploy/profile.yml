### Mandatory ###

## Authentication #
## Ideally for toy deployment 12-16 chars, 1 Cap, 1 num, 1 special. This satisfies password requirements for *most* subsystems
## You should set proper and unique passwords for serious deployments using documented overrides
admin_password: Hadoop123!

### Optional ###
## The following configurations will be applied globally

## Namespace ##

## This will be prefixed to most names used. All deployments should be prefixed to allow differentiation and controlled teardown
## Ideally it should not exceed 6 chars, and must start with a letter, and be <= 4 chars for Azure.
## Will default to the name_prefix in roles/cloudera_deploy/defaults/main.yml if not set
#name_prefix: cldr

## Tags ##

## Tags are applied to deployed infrastructure, particularly chargeable infrastructure on cloud providers
## You should use tags to identify your services to make it easy to track and remove them when no longer needed
#tags:
#  owner: dchaffelson@cloudera.com
#  enddate: "01012022"

## Cloud Infrastructure ##

## Specifies the Cloud Infrastructure provider, CDP presently supports GCP, AWS and Azure
## Not necessary when using static Ansible inventory
#infra_type: aws

## Specify the default region you prefer for your infrastructure provider
## It must be valid for the selected infra_type
## The automation service attempts to validate that the requested build will work in the given region, so some may be rejected
#infra_region: us-east-1

## SSH ##

## Public Key file if using Azure or GCP as Cloud Infrastructure, or deploying Private Cloud
## Should be in your local profile or the Definition Path
## If not supplied one will be generated in the Definition path, along with a matching Private Key file ignoring the private_key_file setting below
#public_key_file: '~/.ssh/mykey.pub'

## Private key file
## Required if deploying Dynamic Inventory to set the Ansible Connection Parameters
## Should be in your local profile or the Definition Path
## Must be set if public_key_file is set
#private_key_file: '~/.ssh/mykey.pem'

## Key Name if using AWS as Cloud Infrastructure
## Defaults to the Namespace if not set
## Must be set if public_key_file is set
#public_key_id: mykey

## Cloudera License ##

## Path to your Cloudera License file
## Required if deploying a CDP Cluster for Private Cloud in a mode other than Trial
## Should be in your local profile or the definition directory
## A cluster with a Trial license will be deployed if this is not specified
#license_file: "~/.cdp/my_cloudera_license_2021.txt"

## Cloud Credentials ##

## Path to Google Cloud Credentials, if using Google Cloud
## Should be in your local profile
## We recommend they should not be located anywhere near a version controlled directory like git to avoid accidental inclusion!
## If using Azure or AWS the credentials will be automatically collected from your local user profile
#gcloud_credential_file: '~/.config/gcloud/mycreds.json'
